# DeepRNN-with-keras
These code is base on Bi-directional LSTM with blood pressure prediction paper, however I'm highly recommand that do not use this code as your homework or product (worse choice).
Since the code what i released is implement without consider a lot of factor about data, which means this model is unstable to predict the bolld pressure!!
But still work to complete my final assignment only~~
